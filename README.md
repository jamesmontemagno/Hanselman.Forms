Hanselman Starter Project for Visual Studio
===============

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Hanselman.Forms converted to a Visual Studio 2015 project template called Hanselman Starter Project.  Its main purpose is to help new cross-platform projects hit the floor running with a framework based on the original sample Hanselman app (see below). 

To manually install this template into your Visual Studio:
---------------

1. Download [HanselmanStarter.zip](https://github.com/AweSamNet/Hanselman.Forms-Starter-Project-Template-for-VS-2015/raw/master/HanselmanStarter.zip)
1. Copy it to `C:\Users\{your-user-account}\Documents\{Visual Studio Version}\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
1. The template can be found in Visual Studio: `File -> New -> Project -> Visual C#`

Hanselman.Forms: Hanselman Everywhere
===============

Built with C# 6 features, you must be running VS 2015 or Xamarin Studio to compile.

The most awesome Hanselman app built in about 4 hours to showcase a sample of [Xamarin.Forms](http://www.xamarin.com/forms). Be sure to read [Scott's](http://www.twitter.com/shanselman) blog: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/XamarinFormsWriteOnceRunEverywhereANDBeNative.aspx

In this sample Hanselman app we show awesome information about the awesome man who is Scott Hanselman including reading in his blog & parsing with XDocument. Additionally, I use Linq2Twitter PCL to grab all of Scott's tweets, all using a nice MVVM Style and nearly 100% code reuse.

Android Wear

To setup Android wear simply install the main Hanselman app on your Android Phone and then the **WearApp** on your Android Wear device. HanselWear uses Google Play Services to synchronize Tweets from the main application. The code for this sync can be found in WearService.cs.
